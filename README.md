# LivelyGraph: API Aggregator and Data Query Platform

LivelyGraph is an open-source platform that aggregates and queries data from various APIs. It allows users to seamlessly compile their personal and business data and gain insights through querying and analysis. The project is still in its planning phase and we're excited about the features we're planning to bring.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **API Connectors**: Access a wide range of APIs and aggregate your data in one place.
- **Raw Data Browsing**: Browse the raw data directly on our platform.
- **GraphQL Interface**: Query your aggregated data in a customized and flexible way.
- **Large Language Model (LLM) Integration**: Ask questions in natural language and get accurate answers from your aggregated data.
- **Data Ownership**: Retain full ownership of your data. We prioritize data privacy and integrity.

## Usage Scenarios (Planned)

- **Personal Use**: Aggregate your social media, fitness tracker, bank account data, and more. Query this data for insights such as your location on a particular date or an analysis of your spending habits.
- **Business Use**: Companies can aggregate and analyze business data from various sources, such as sales, customer, or employee data.

## Open Source

LivelyGraph is open source under the Apache License 2.0. We welcome contributions to extend its functionality.

## Platform & Documentation (Planned)

LivelyGraph is an API-first platform. Comprehensive API documentation will be provided in the future. Mobile and web applications are planned for later phases.

## Future Developments

We're planning to transition to a SaaS model and introduce an App Store for third-party apps. Developers will be able to create apps using our GraphQL and LLM functions to provide users with powerful visualizations and analyses.
