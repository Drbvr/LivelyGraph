# LivelyGraph: API Aggregator and Data Query Platform

Welcome to LivelyGraph, an open-source API Aggregator and Data Query Platform, designed to aggregate, query, and analyze data from various APIs. Our powerful tool allows users to seamlessly aggregate their personal and business data and gain insights through querying and analysis.

## Features

- **API Connectors**: LivelyGraph offers connectors to a wide variety of APIs, enabling users to aggregate their data in one place.
- **Raw Data Browsing**: Users can browse the raw data from the APIs directly on our platform.
- **GraphQL Interface**: LivelyGraph provides a GraphQL interface for users to query their aggregated data in a customized and flexible way.
- **Large Language Model (LLM) Integration**: We integrate an advanced LLM for natural language querying. Users can ask questions in natural language, and the LLM processes data from all connected accounts to provide accurate answers.
- **Data Ownership**: Users retain ownership of their data. LivelyGraph prioritizes data privacy and integrity.

## For Personal Use

Aggregate your data from social media accounts, fitness trackers, bank accounts, and more. Your data will never leave your own system unless you choose so. Query this data to gain insights like where you were on a particular date or analyze your spending habits.

## For Business Use

Companies can aggregate business data from various sources to gain valuable insights. Whether it's sales data, customer data, or employee data, LivelyGraph enables quick, comprehensive analysis.

## Open Source

LivelyGraph is fully open source under the Apache License 2.0. We encourage developers to contribute to the project and extend its functionality.

## Platform & Documentation

LivelyGraph is an API-first platform. We'll be providing comprehensive API documentation to guide users on how to connect and work with different APIs. Mobile and web applications will be developed in later phases.

## Future Developments

We're planning to transition to a SaaS model and introduce an App Store for third-party apps. Developers can create apps using our GraphQL and LLM functions to offer users powerful visualizations and analyses.
