## LivelyGraph: Your Data, Your Way

LivelyGraph is an open-source platform that empowers you to aggregate, query, and analyze your data from various online services, all in one place. With features like API connectors, GraphQL interface, and LLM integration, LivelyGraph offers a seamless, valuable, and secure experience. It allows users to seamlessly compile their personal and business data and gain insights through querying and analysis. The project is still in its planning phase and we're excited about the features we're planning to bring.

- **Aggregate Your Data**: Connect your accounts and view all your data in one place.
- **Query Your Data**: Use our GraphQL interface or natural language queries.
- **Retain Ownership**: Your data belongs to you. We prioritize data ownership and privacy.
- **Permission-Based Sharing**: Share your data on your terms.
- **Interoperability**: Easily integrate with other systems.

- **Business Use**: Companies can aggregate and analyze business data from various sources, such as sales, customer, or employee data.

## Design Principles

LivelyGraph is built on three foundational principles:

1. **Data at the source**: Data is retrieved directly from the source whenever possible instead of copies to the LivelyGraph-platform.
2. **Data Ownership**: Data owners maintain control over when, how, and by whom their data is used. Processed data is kept on the users system only.
3. **Open source**: LivelyGraph is open source under the Apache License 2.0. We welcome contributions to extend its functionality.

These principles guide our approach to creating a transparent, user-centric platform. For more detailed information on our design principles, please visit our [Design Principles](https://github.com/Drbvr/LivelyGraph/wiki/Design-Principles) wiki page.

## Platform & Documentation (Planned)

LivelyGraph is an API-first platform. Comprehensive API documentation will be provided in the future. Mobile and web applications are planned for later phases.
