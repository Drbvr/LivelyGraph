# Planned Features

LivelyGraph is currently under development and aims to offer a robust set of features that will simplify the process of aggregating and querying data from various APIs. Below are the main features we plan to implement in LivelyGraph:

- **API Connectors**:
  We plan to provide connectors to a wide variety of APIs, enabling users to aggregate their data in one place. Whether it's personal data from social media accounts and fitness trackers or business data from different sources, our API connectors will make data aggregation easy.

- **Raw Data Browsing**:
  Users will be able to directly browse the raw data from the connected APIs on our platform. This feature will be useful for users who want to quickly view their data without any additional processing or querying.

- **GraphQL Interface**:
  LivelyGraph will offer a powerful GraphQL interface for users to query their aggregated data in a customized and flexible way. With GraphQL, users will be able to create complex queries and get the exact data they need.

- **Large Language Model (LLM) Integration**:
  We have plans to integrate an advanced LLM that will allow users to query their data using natural language. Users will be able to ask questions like "Where was I on December 12, 2012?" and the LLM will process the data from all connected accounts to provide accurate answers.

- **Data Ownership**:
  Users will retain complete ownership of their data. LivelyGraph will prioritize data privacy and integrity, ensuring that users have full control over their data.

We will provide more information and documentation on each of these features as we progress with the development of LivelyGraph. Stay tuned for updates on the following pages:
