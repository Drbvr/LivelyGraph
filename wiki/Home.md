## Design principles
LivelyGraph is built on three foundational principles:

1. Data at the source: Data is retrieved directly from the source whenever possible instead of copies to the LivelyGraph-platform.
2. Data Ownership: Data owners maintain control over when, how, and by whom their data is used. Processed data is kept on the users system only.
3. Open source: LivelyGraph is open source under the Apache License 2.0. We welcome contributions to extend its functionality.

These principles guide our approach to creating a transparent, user-centric platform. For more detailed information on our design principles, please visit our [[Design Principles|design-principles]] wiki page.
