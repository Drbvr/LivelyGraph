# Welcome to LivelyGraph Wiki

LivelyGraph is an innovative open-source API Aggregator and Data Query Platform, designed to empower users to aggregate, query, and analyze data from various APIs with ease.

## Key Features

- API Connectors for seamless data aggregation.
- Raw Data Browsing to view data directly.
- GraphQL Interface for custom data querying.
- Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language querying.
- Data Ownership with a focus on privacy and integrity.

## Design principles
LivelyGraph is built on three foundational principles:

1. Data at the source: Data is retrieved directly from the source whenever possible instead of copies to the LivelyGraph-platform.
2. Data Ownership: Data owners maintain control over when, how, and by whom their data is used. Processed data is kept on the users system only.
3. Open source: LivelyGraph is open source under the Apache License 2.0. We welcome contributions to extend its functionality.

These principles guide our approach to creating a transparent, user-centric platform. For more detailed information on our design principles, please visit our [[Design Principles|design-principles]] wiki page.
