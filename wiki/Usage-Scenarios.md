# Usage Scenarios

LivelyGraph, once fully developed, will be a powerful tool for both individuals and businesses seeking to aggregate and query data from multiple sources. Here are some of the scenarios in which LivelyGraph could be useful:

## For Individuals:

- **Personal Data Aggregation**: Users will be able to connect their social media accounts, fitness trackers, bank accounts, and other personal data sources to LivelyGraph. This will allow them to easily browse and query all their data in one place.

- **Insights and Analysis**: By aggregating data from various sources, users can gain insights into their habits, trends, and patterns. For example, they could analyze their spending habits or track their fitness progress over time.

- **Memory and Search**: Users can use the LLM integration to ask questions like "Where was I on December 12, 2012?" The platform will then search through the connected accounts and provide the answer.

## For Businesses:

- **Business Data Aggregation**: Businesses can use LivelyGraph to aggregate data from various sources such as sales platforms, marketing tools, and customer support systems. This will provide them with a holistic view of their operations.

- **Analytics and Reporting**: With the GraphQL interface, businesses can create custom queries to generate detailed reports and analytics. This can help them understand their performance and make informed decisions.

- **Integration with Business Intelligence Tools**: LivelyGraph can serve as a data hub for businesses, feeding data into BI tools for advanced analytics and visualization.

- **API Hub for Startups**: Startups can use LivelyGraph to aggregate data from various APIs they work with, reducing the complexity of handling multiple API connections.
